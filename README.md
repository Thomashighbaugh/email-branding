<h1>Email templates</h1>

<details>
<summary><h2>Introduction</h2></summary>
<p>Having experimented with several frameworks for composing emails in HTML, I have found they are all somewhat more clunky than simply writing out templates for emails myself and including them here as a means of accessing them and using them locally with Thunderbird and an extension for it to edit HTML. Despite the power of Tailwind.css I could access via the Maizzle framework, I found that really much of what I wanted to do with the CSS I could include in the templates themselves, which renders to a much smaller overall size than with Maizzle as the purge.css would not work right with that framework when I tried it.</p>
<p>Therefore I have adapted this repository to house the templates that I use, which I am going to wire together as a super simple HTML site to browse if you so choose and for practice in writing out simple sites. Unlike other sites I have written in plain HTML, CSS and JS, not all of this one's pages will reference common JS and CSS assets as the templates need to include all of that within themselves as per their nature as templates.</p>
